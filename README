To compile you need to put iText ( http://www.lowagie.com/iText/download.html )
and junit4 ( http://www.junit.org/ ) into the lib/ dir. Then just call ant version 1.7+
(if you want to generate the java5 version pass -Djre5.dir="C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.5.0_15")

Note that you have to compile using a jdk 6, since there's a bug in the version 5 (can't
throw a generic)

To validate XML (needed for JUnit tests) you need to download http://java.net/downloads/msv/releases/msv.20090415.zip and
put msv.jar, relaxngDatatype.jar, xsdlib.jar and isorelax.jar in the classpath.

Google docs
-----------
jOpenDocument created documents should be compatible but (at least for spreadsheets) Google only accepts lower case automatic style names.
